00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:04,546
Hello, welcome to the Create Access website.

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:09,409
Create Access is about bridging the opportunity gaps in tech by offering accessible pathways

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,064
to 3D creation. And this website is

4
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:18,759
built to be able to expand upon the website that Create Access

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,034
already uses. To be to best succeed,

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,444
successfully help their students,

7
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:27,940
their partners, and anybody coming across their website.

8
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,402
To be able to best use their tutorials,

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,105
contact them, donate to them,

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,969
support the company in any way.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,651
To be able to expand the 3D learning space.

12
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,971
firstly, we go over the home screen that we created,

13
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:46,565
or the home page that we created.

14
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:50,132
we started off by making sure that it got straight to the point,

15
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,955
being able to explain what this website is for,

16
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:56,917
and then being able to show the resources for that.

17
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:01,300
off some of the modeling for 3D creation,

18
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,742
what are some of the things that they can create. down below,

19
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:09,198
exploring what the journey of Create Access can show

20
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:09,969
you, what you can,

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,415
build upon, and some of the collaborators and businesses that partner with.

22
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:19,966
create access to be able to enhance these tutorials and the learning for students.

23
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:24,552
On here, our plan would be to expand upon it to a full page.

24
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:29,738
As more partners come in, as descriptions or their roles change,

25
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:34,318
that would be the page that people- to see those changes and

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,870
be able to be caught up.

27
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,272
firstly, on the Nav Bar, we kept it simple,

28
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:42,947
with the main things that you needed as any type of user on

29
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:45,659
the website to be best- succeed on it.

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,040
which would be the courses,

31
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,283
the About Us text, I have to learn more about the company,

32
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:53,745
a way to contact directly and donate section,

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,870
and then the download would be directly for the software being used,

34
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:01,213
which would be downloaded directly from Epic Store.

35
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:05,519
Firstly, let's start off with the courses. So for the courses,

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,909
the one problem that we- so with the main website was just unclear of

37
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:10,965
where to start.

38
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:16,871
so right away, what we wanted to begin with was showing the microcourses

39
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:20,339
hub, showing exactly what the software you're using is,

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,622
and a way to just begin right away.

41
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,759
So when you go off of the courses,

42
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:30,023
you have the option right here to just read on what the software you're

43
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,046
using, which is Unreal, and the Unreal Engine Editor,

44
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:37,070
which is a free software that Epic does provide,

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,072
for people to work on, create games,

46
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,684
expand upon a four-night, three-model,

47
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:42,444
etc.

48
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:45,607
and we do add some guides at the bottom that show a lot of

49
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,940
the different movements,

50
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:51,974
the controls that you would need to understand what to do in these softwares,

51
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:56,719
which is very helpful and accessible to all people using those tutorials.

52
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,342
right away, we wanted to make, sure that we had a section that could

53
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:03,451
go right into the different tutorials that you can go through.

54
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:05,780
So we have, as soon as you hit,

55
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:09,338
start learning, we can pick through the different courses that we have.

56
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:12,869
Right now, for sake of implementation,

57
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,621
we added just two.

58
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:18,703
so when you go into here, it brings you through the courses,

59
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,161
where you'd be able to begin in order of which one you want to

60
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:27,725
go to, and you'll see the videos directly from the YouTube uploaded

61
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:30,475
videos that are provided from Create Access.

62
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,171
And through that, you'd be able to see,

63
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,438
all the guides, everything that you need,

64
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:40,746
and even link you directly to the PDF files for

65
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:44,950
the projects themselves so that you can visually see the steps as you're going

66
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,135
through the video.

67
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:48,122
As we do that,

68
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:52,056
it creates a way more cleaner and simple way for students to be able

69
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:56,551
to follow along, which helps in the long run of people staying on the

70
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,953
website, finishing their tutorials,

71
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:02,199
finishing, learning how to do 3D creation,

72
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:06,864
and in the end, makes creative- access more successful in the long run.

73
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,648
After this, we have the about section,

74
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:15,740
where we directly will go through the mission for create

75
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:20,277
access, what brings them, what drives them, the future plans so that it's

76
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:22,497
very clear to people that want to partner,

77
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:27,131
people that want to join, what the- what the movement of the company is,

78
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:30,314
where they're leaning towards, where they're hoping to achieve to,

79
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,476
and making that a hundred percent clear, especially,

80
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:37,462
since the whole point is for people to be able to join without restrictions,

81
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:41,245
it's a lot easier if people can see that fully laid out.

82
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:46,670
another way to just link them to connecting directly with Create Access

83
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,473
through e-mail, and be able to record that directly off the website,

84
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:55,660
and being able to see the full team of people that are amazingly

85
00:04:55,661 --> 00:05:00,244
being able to increase and create an environment in this company

86
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:04,809
that lets- people learn amazing skills that they

87
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,801
wouldn't have been able to anywhere else.

88
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,392
so whether that's founders, the educators,

89
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,985
or some of the interns involved,

90
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,408
they'll be able to learn what their names are, who's gonna be actually helping

91
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,033
them and see that team. From there we also have just the contact

92
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:22,266
page. Again, this is where they'll be able to put their emails,

93
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:25,639
send a message to them so that they can get back to them and

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,662
best communicate with the team directly, I created access.

95
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:32,706
there's also a donation page which allows people that want to support and may

96
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,029
not be able to physically, you know, join the program,

97
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,801
but be able to continuously.

98
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:43,849
Give their support to a company that's trying to give free programming to students.

99
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:48,275
And then finally, the download page will bring you directly to the Epic Store

100
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:53,281
where they'll be able to find and download the support

101
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,912
for the Epic.

102
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:59,046
Unreal Engine Epic Engine.

103
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:03,199
that is our implementation for Create Access.

104
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,768
Although there's obviously a lot of things that we want to continue to add

105
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:11,232
to it. This is the structure and we feel like it simplifies it in

106
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:15,688
the best way that we can to be able to successfully support the students

107
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,984
and being able to quickly get to their courses, but also people that want

108
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:22,340
to learn and see all the in-depth information for it.

109
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:24,664
Thank you. Have a good day.
