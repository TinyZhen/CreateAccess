## Project Proposal 
Problem Statement: Many Students and Individuals encounter challenges when entering high-impact fields like 3D creation due to limited access to beginner-friendly resources. These challenges are having fewer connections in the Tech world, not knowing where to start learning from, and uncertainty about leveraging these skills for career advancement.

From a user point of view as computer science students, we want to explore 3D creation in a way that is easy to understand and accessible to beginners like us. We need a resource that can build our confidence and help us see how these skills can be applied to real-world problems and future job opportunities.

User's Goal: 
- Learning the basics of 3D creation by working on practical problems.
- Developing confidence in applying 3D creation skills to projects.
- Understanding how it can help one build their career.

User's Action: 
- Practice using 3D tools on small projects to gain experience
- exploring the skills and learning for future opportunities.

User's Potential Obstacles: 
- It is difficult to know where to start because of the limited exposure to 3D creation tools




Finding convenient and engaging learning opportunities is a challenge for users who are interested in 3-D creation but lack experience or resources. Users want to explore 3D authoring to open up new possibilities for creative and professional development. However, they often encounter the following barriers:

- High cost: Traditional 3D tools and training can be costly, preventing many from participating.
- Lack of support: Beginners are confused by the complexity of 3D creation and struggle to find reliable resources that are easy to get started.
- Lack of opportunity awareness: Many people are unaware of the career paths associated with 3D creation.

CreateAccess is committed to removing these barriers and helping users get started by offering free mini-courses. However, the existing website's user interface is not intuitive enough to quickly engage and guide users, especially first-time visitors. In addition, mobile access and accessibility features have not been fully optimized.
