## Project Proposal 
Problem Statement: Many Students and Individuals encounter challenges when entering high-impact fields like 3D creation due to limited access to beginner-friendly resources. These challenges are having fewer connections in the Tech world, not knowing where to start learning from, and uncertainty about leveraging these skills for career advancement.

From a user point of view as computer science students, we want to explore 3D creation in a way that is easy to understand and accessible to beginners like us. We need a resource that can build our confidence and help us see how these skills can be applied to real-world problems and future job opportunities.

User's Goal: 
- Learning the basics of 3D creation by working on practical problems.
- Developing confidence in applying 3D creation skills to projects.
- Understanding how it can help one build their career.

User's Action: 
- Practice using 3D tools on small projects to gain experience
- exploring the skills and learning for future opportunities.

User's Potential Obstacles: 
- It is difficult to know where to start because of the limited exposure to 3D creation tools

CreateAccess is committed to removing these barriers and helping users get started by offering free mini-courses. However, the existing website's user interface is not intuitive enough to quickly engage and guide users, especially first-time visitors. In addition, mobile access and accessibility features have not been fully optimized.
